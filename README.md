# File Integrity Monitor

## Overview

The following PowerShell code is a Proof of Concept for a File Intergrity Monitor (FIM). A File Integrity Monitor is a software that validates the integrity of operating system and application software files using a verification method between the current file state and a known good state also called Baseline. By associating a hash with each file and creating a baseline, we can check if/which files have been changed. Why is this important? Integrity is part of the CIA triad of cybersecurity. Making sure files have not been changed or tampered with is a defensive measure for data to be authentic, accurate, and reliable.

### Code Flow

The FIM starts by asking the user if they would like to create a new baseline file (Path A) or begin monitoring files with a saved baseline (Path B). The baseline file contains the stored hashes of files we want to integrity-check. By default users will pick Path A because it is assumed there is no existing baseline file.

In Path A, the script will create hash values using SHA-512 for all target files listed in the path provided by the user. These hashes will be stored in a 'baseline.txt' file. 

In Path B, the user can begin monitoring files with a saved baseline. The script will calculate the hashes for the target files and compare them with the hashes stored in the 'baseline.txt' file. If a file has been changed or deleted, the script will output the compromised file, otherwise it will report no changes. 

### Notes

The target files that will be checked are referenced in the script to be in the same directory. When calling the files to calculate hashes, the script references .\Files. To test the script: Add the target files in the same directory as the script in a folder named 'Files'. The 'baseline.txt' file will be generated in the same directory as the script and 'Files' folder.

The script also shows live changes and this can be tested by adding new files or editting existing files while the script is running!
